This directory contains the source files for HRPT reading.

Currently the following are supported:

              From Oleg's tool       From XHRPT    From J-L deframed Modis
NOAA                                   .raw16
FY               .C10                  .bin
Metop            .hpt                  .bin
MN2              .dat                  .bin
Aqua MODIS                                              .bin

Use ./hrpt.exe --help for command line explanation - this is essential to do !


Building the software is done as follows:

./buildhrpt.sh

This builds hrpt.exe and the support s/w polarstereo.exe, readbin.exe and readbin_modis.exe

as the software is TLE based it needs a TLE file. I download these daily from 
the web site with a crontab script:

#!/bin/bash
mytlefile=/share/Public/TLE/`(date +%Y%m%d)`-weather.tle
wget --secure-protocol=auto https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/weather.txt
mv weather.txt $mytlefile
mytlefile=/share/Public/TLE/`(date +%Y%m%d)`-resource.tle
wget --secure-protocol=auto https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/resource.txt
mv resource.txt $mytlefile

this creates a file like:

20190306-weather.tle

and

20190306-resource.tle

my s/w uses the data from the HRPT filename to find the equivalent date TLE 
file (and also tries 1 day earlier and later) in that directory.

This directory is defined by an environment variable defined as follows:

Ubuntu Virtualbox VM :

export TLE=/home/fjansen/Win7/TLE/

which under cygwin could be e.g.

export TLE=/cygdrive/d/TLE/

and under WSL:

export TLE=/mnt/d/TLE/

The output from the programs goes to HRPTOUT , also an environment variable.


The hrpt.exe program can generate 

- Per channel B/W images
- A merged 3 channel image and a geometry corrected version
- A polar stereographic projected 3 channel colour version
- A few images indicating the swath of the observation and the subsatellite tracked
  (with an option to also show a defined solar zenith angle 'sunset' line)
- A intensity histogram plot per channel
- A cumulative solar zenith angle distribution, used when defining a merge with an 
  IR channel
- Merged visual and IR channel images

Usually the program runs as:

./hrpt.exe filename N 221 gapcor project=221 border gamma=0.95

For the FY and NOAA-19 satellites the borders align well with the images. For 
some reason for NOAA-18 and Metop this is less good. For this there is a 
theta= option. For Southern passes this is negative, for northern passes 
positive. This value represents a rotation of the scan angle (in degrees) 
around the nadir vector to the subsatellite point.
For MetopC you would normally run:

./hrpt.exe filename N 221 gapcor project=221 border gamma=0.95 theta=2.7

or 

./hrpt.exe filename S 221 gapcor project=221 border gamma=0.95 theta=-2.7

for a southern pass. For NOAA-18 the angle is around 0.7 degree.

If you want to use mergehrpt it is important to get this angle right !!!!!!
(as it defines the accuracy of the geometric alignment)

The szalim, szamerge and szafact define the IR channel merging. Example:

./hrpt.exe filename N 221 gapcor project=221 gamma=0.95 szalim=85.0 szamerge=4 szafact=1.2

(you can off course also switch on the border and theta= command)
This would merge the channel 4 IR image multiplied by a factor 1.2 (on top of 
an auto-normalisation) for all pixels where the solar zenith angle is above 85 
degrees. There actually is a 'soft' gradual merge from a few degrees below 
to a few degrees above the user defined value.

The mergehrpt program uses a different command style. Example:

./mergehrpt.exe mergefiles.txt S project=221 gamma=0.95 border bestres

where mergefiles.txt contains:

../Win7/HRPT-Data/Decoded/FY/FY3C_2019-01-19_0945.C10 theta=0.01 linedelay=-6
../Win7/HRPT-Data/Decoded/Metop/2019-01-19_0959_M02.hpt theta=-2.7 linedelay=3

the theta values are what you derive from the hrpt program as outlined 
above. IMPORTANT: If you define theta for one file it HAS to appear for all files.
If you want to use theta as 0 degrees, specify e.g. theta=0.01 but NOT theta=0.0 
as this has a special meaning inside the s/w (an experimental latitude based auto 
correction).
The text file defining which passes to merge can contain five lines at most !

The linedelay option is a subtlety. If on the left side of the images the borders 
are below the country in the image and on the right hand side the other way around, 
you need theta to correct. If there is an apparent left and right symmetrical 
displacement of the borders with the actual countries, you can use linedelay 
to change the timestamp of all scanlines by a multiple of 167 msec. The FY 
satellites sometimes suffer from this. A small value should do.
For mergehrpt the same holds as for theta : if you use it for one file you HAVE TO 
define it for all. linedelay=0 is an OK option.

TROUBLESHOOTING : 

In case of imagemagick complaints about limits being exceeded:

cat /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml

and check the constraints. I now use in WSL :

  <policy domain="resource" name="memory" value="1GiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="map" value="2GiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="width" value="32KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="height" value="32KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="area" value="900MB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="4GiB"/>

  This also helped me to significantly speed up the sharpen process !
  
Currently the s/w runs best in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) :-(
It allows you to generate ELF exe files, which you need for memory space and cygwin 
won't allow. Limitation is that it only mounts NTFS HD's and USB devices, NOT a NAS !

Install:
- In windows 10 search for "feature"  or "turn windows features" and start "turn windows features on or off"
- Scroll to Windows Subsystem for Linux and enable it, then OK etc etc
- Go to : https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab
- click download and login with microsoft account - if you don't have it, create one
- You get a number of questions (user, password etc) and end up with a windows command 
  shell in which you type ubuntu1804 and ubuntu starts
- In this shell:
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get install gfortran
  - sudo apt-get install imagemagick
- tar -xvzf hrpt.tgz
- cd HRPT
- READ !!!!! the README file
- ./buildhrpt.sh
- ./hrpt.exe --help

Go to the top end try setting the environment variables and run an example


Enjoy.

-- Corrupted NOAA file (gave no output and also ReadHRPT from David Taylor complained)

I've seen a case of a corrupted NOAA .raw16 file coming from XHRPT. This was the 
recipe for the cure:

1. Dump the file to a log file on a partition visible to windows:

od -A d -t x1 --width=70 NOAA-19_HRPT_20190309_043441.raw16 >> ../Win7/odraw16.log

2. Open the file in wordpad and do a ctrl-F for:

84 02 6F 01 5C 03 9D 01 0F 02 95

if not found, redo step 1 with e.g. a width of 60 or 71 or something

3. Locate the position of the byte before (!) the start of the signature. Let call this 
   number N. Then calculate:
   
   mod(N,22180)    and letÅ› call the result L
   
4. Cut of the dummy info (example) - the + before the number L is crucial :

tail -c +L ../Win7/SDR/To-Process/NOAA-19_HRPT_20190309_043441.raw16 >> NOAA-19_HRPT_20190309_043441.raw16

so in this case L was 3017:

tail -c +3017 ../Win7/SDR/To-Process/NOAA-19_HRPT_20190309_043441.raw16 >> NOAA-19_HRPT_20190309_043441.raw16

5. then run:

./hrpt.exe ./NOAA-19_HRPT_20190309_043441.raw16 S 445 gapcor project=445 gamma=0.9 border debug >& ../Win7/hrpt.log

and check in the log that the records start with the signature hex chain above.
If so, you were succesful
